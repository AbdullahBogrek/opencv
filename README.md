## General Information

It is a project that I made a OpenCV library, which has features such as taking photos, recording videos, applying effects to the image, detecting colors, drawing shapes or lines on the screen. And also, I am designing a GUI to use these features with the tkinter library. With this GUI, I want to develop an application that recording videos, taking pictures, applying color space filters, thresholding, detect shapes in user-uploaded images.

## Technologies

- cv2           - v4.5.0
- numpy         - v1.23.0
- PIL           - v9.2.0
- tkinter       - v8.6.0
- pygubu        - v0.24.0

## Features

- You can take a photo and recording a video.
- You can apply effect to the images. 
- You can detections color.
- You can draw shapes or lines on the screen.

### To do:

- An interface will be designed using tkinter.
- The feature of drawing with canvas will be added.
- Image cropping and rotating features will be added.

## Acknowledgements

- The project is not finished. GUI is still in the design phase. Due to my graduation project, I could not develop many projects. But I will continue to develop it soon.
